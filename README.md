# Handwriting-Recognition

These are 2 different approaches to recognise handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. For the best results, use the neural network. If you are experiencing inaccurate results with recognising images, ensure your digit is in the middle of the image and try using different line widths. Alternatively, you could download and use the full MNIST dataset. For the neural network, ensure the digits are black on a white background. For the K Nearest Neighbours model, ensre digits are white on a black background.
