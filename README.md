# Handwriting-Recognition

This program uses the KNN machine learning model to attempt to recognise handwritten digits by using a condensed version of the MNIST dataset.
 Instructions for use:
 Ensure you have numpy, PIL and pandas installed.
 Edit handwriting_image.bmp in an application like paint, then run knn_model.py.
If you are importing another image, ensure it is 28x28 pixels and edit line 78.
If you are experiencing inaccurate results, ensure your digit is in the middle of the image and try using different line widths. Alternatively, you could download and use the full MNIST dataset.
