Neural network

This is a neural network designed to predict handwritten digits. It has 1 hidden layer that can contain any number of hidden neurons. I have provided a pre-trained neural network with 250 hidden nodes, a learning rate of 0.01, and 10 epochs. See instructions for use in the docstring in the file main.py
